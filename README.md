# -Student-Enrollment-and-Job-Management-System-SQL-NoSQL-

The Student Enrollment and Job Management System is designed to streamline the process of student 
registration, course enrollment, faculty assignment, and job placements for students. This system will 
enable universities and colleges to manage academic data efficiently, track student enrollment in 
courses, and connect students with employment opportunities. 

# Data Management: 
The system will maintain several tables to manage data effectively. The Students Table will store 
essential information about students such as personal details and enrollment date. The Departments 
Table will track academic departments, associating students with specific fields of study. The Courses 
Table will list available courses, their sections, and credits, while the Faculty Table will manage faculty 
details, linking them to the courses they teach. 

# Key Functionalities: 
• Course Enrollment: Students can browse and enroll in available courses based on their 
department and program requirements. 
• Departmental and Faculty Management: Students will be assigned to departments for 
academic guidance, and courses will be mapped to specific faculty members. 
• Job Placement: Through the StudentJob Table, students can be linked to job opportunities, with 
details such as job type, hours per week, and start and end dates. 
• Grade Tracking: The StudentCourseGrade Table will track student performance in courses, 
recording their grades for analysis and reporting. 

# Reporting & Analytics: 
The system will generate various reports, including student enrollments, course demand, faculty 
workload, and student work experience. This will provide valuable insights for academic and 
administrative planning. 
The system will enhance the efficiency of managing student enrollments, streamline course and job 
placement processes, and support academic progress tracking for both students and faculty.
